--- Setup ---

Setup this project for eclipse:

import the project:
"File/Import/Android/Existing Android ...".
Find the project and click "ok".
Select The "SonyLogger" and "SonyLoggerTest" projects.
Click finish. (You might have to import the two projects
separately to get the eclipse import to play along.)

In the "SonyLogger" project:
Open "Properties/Java build path/Order and export" and
deselect "Android Private Libraries".
This will stop gson from being built into the lib (if
you use gson externally or in the tests project building
it into the lib would cause dex errors during build).

In the SonyLoggerTest project:
Open "Properties/Java build path/Project" and click add.
Select the "SonyLogger project" and click ok.

You should now have both projects setup and building
in eclipse.
